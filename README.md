Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify patients as high risk or low risk based on various health-related features, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains health records of patients, with features that include:

Age: The patient's age.

Gender: The patient's gender.

Cholesterol Levels: Levels of cholesterol in the blood.

Blood Pressure: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Max Heart Rate: The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.

Electrocardiographic Results: Results from ECG tests.

Other Medical Information: Data such as fasting blood sugar, exercise induced angina, and ST depression.

This dataset is widely used for predicting heart disease and can be found in the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

Project Overview
In this project, several machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict heart disease. The models are trained using the features of the dataset to classify the outcome as either "heart disease" or "no heart disease."

Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: A simple and effective algorithm for binary classification.

Random Forest: A powerful ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates the data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification based on feature similarity.

Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to improve accuracy.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for implementation.

scikit-learn: A machine learning library for building and evaluating models.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and creating graphs.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Installation

Usage
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is first loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values and scaling features for better performance with machine learning algorithms.

Training the Model:

Each model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure the model is not overfitting.

Model Evaluation:

The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine the best model for heart disease prediction.
